# About
This is for Secion 6 of Mutating Data.

I am doing this a little differently. The last project was in regular JavaScript and explored data fetching.
I decided to start this with TypeScript.

I just did an initial commit of the files and converted to TypeScript. I want to practice in a TS environment more.

## What is covered:
This project will cover Mutating Data, Next Server Actions/



## Neat things

### Server Actions
- Able to use server actions in NextJS that are essentially functions ran on the server, that can fetch and post.
